# To-Do:
  1. Create and store "quote" attributes
  2. Check number of arguments for $quote, and limit to <= 3

# Future features:

  * $quote @user "quote" -> manually-written quote
  * $quote @user -> last sent message from user
  * $quote @user message-link -> linked message from user
  * error-checking for (1) user has sent a message before (2) a user is pinged after $quote
  * scroll through embedded quote cards with emotes (like Mudae)
