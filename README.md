# To-Do:
- [ ] Create and store "quote" documents
- [ ] ```$quote "quote"``` -> manually-written quote by author
- [ ] ```$quote message-link``` -> linked message from user
- [x] ```$quote @user``` -> last sent message from user
- [ ] $help command
- [ ] Have "title" field in each document
- [ ] Scrollable embedded messages via emoting

# Future:
  * error-checking for (1) user has sent a message before (2) a user is pinged after $quote
  * scroll through embedded quote cards with emotes (like Mudae)

# Improbable:
  * ```$quote @user "quote"``` -> manually-written quote by pinged user (2 args)
